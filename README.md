# BasicJavaGame

This is a very basic, terminal-based game written in java. The purpose of making this game is:

1) To develop my programming ability.
2) To learn more about how collaborative programming works through practice. (Currently, I am the only one working on this game.)
3) To make something cool!

The game is run in the terminal, but in the future might GUI... It's a work in progress, so I'll add more in here as features develop haha.

Below are some screenshots to give an idea of how the game looks, for now:
