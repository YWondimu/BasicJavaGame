# BasicJavaGame

This is (will be) a very basic, terminal-based game written in java. The purpose of making this game is:

1) To develop our programming ability
2) To learn more about how collaborative programming works (through practice)
3) To make something cool

The game is run in the terminal, and might or might not include a GUI... It's a work in progress, so I'll add more in here as features develop haha.

Here's a screenshot to give an idea of how the game will look, for now:
